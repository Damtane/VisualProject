# VisualProject
Practicing more with python and creating GUIs to have a visual of an object moving

Need:
- Learn how to make a GUI that can both present a visual moving 
object and create a way to be able to effect it (weight, gravity, etc.)
- Study on how Python works again (I may have forgotten a bit)
